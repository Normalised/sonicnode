# sonicnode

node js script for watching files to send to a sonic pi ruby server.

## Sonic Pi Ruby Server

First get sonic-pi-server.rb running by itself. I use that horrible piserve.bat file for now.

## Code Watcher Install

`npm install`

## Run Code Watcher

`npm start`

This will watch a file called 'music.rb' and send it to Sonic Pi when it's saved.

The file will be created if it doesn't exist.
